I wrote this maze solver and solution checker in 
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/) to help me judge the
[third annual Codeslinger competition](http://www.gatorlug.org/node/233).

[This page](http://www.gatorlug.org/node/234) shows other solutions, as well as a picture of the 
Fastest Codeslinger of 2009: Robert Munyer.
